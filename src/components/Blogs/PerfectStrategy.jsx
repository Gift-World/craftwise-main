      `Let’s be honest , most of us love a good strategy session. It’s like planning a dream vacation: mapping out every detail, imagining how smooth everything will go, picturing the perfect outcome. And then reality hits, you miss your flight, lose your luggage, and end up eating questionable airport sandwiches. That’s what happens when execution doesn’t match strategy.
`,

      `Some companies treat strategy like an ancient scroll sacred, untouchable, and the key to all wisdom. They spend months (or years!) refining it, convinced they’ve cracked the code. But here’s the catch no matter how brilliant the plan, if you don’t execute it well, it’s as useful as a GPS with no signal. Markets change, competitors aren’t waiting, and customers? They have the attention span of a goldfish. Perfection is a fantasy.
`,
`Execution is where the magic happens. A mediocre plan executed with energy beats a flawless plan gathering dust. Look at Nokia and Apple. Nokia had the tech and the talent but fumbled the execution. Apple? They nailed it with a relentless focus on making things work in real life, not just in boardrooms.

`,

      ` 1. Nobody Got the Memo –  If your team doesn’t understand the plan, good luck getting it done.
2. Leadership in a Bubble - If leaders are too busy strategizing and not dealing with reality, execution falls apart.
3. Change? No Thanks - Some companies resist change like a cat resists a bath . Adaptability is key!
4. Set It and Forget It Syndrome - Execution isn’t a slow cooker  you have to check, tweak, and adjust constantly.

   `,

      `Winning isn’t about having the fanciest plan. It’s about making things happen. Here’s how:

• Keep strategy simple and flexible (like a good stretch before a workout ) 

• Hire leaders who know how to bridge the gap between planning and doing  

• Make sure your team actually knows what’s expected and give them the power to act 

• Track progress and be ready to pivot when needed (because nothing ever goes exactly to plan)


At the end of the day, strategy is just a fancy word for “what we plan to do.” Execution is actually doing it. So, instead of aiming for the perfect plan, focus on making things happen  and don’t forget to enjoy the ride!
